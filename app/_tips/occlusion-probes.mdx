> üí° This discusses specifically the implementation used in The Book of the Dead, which is something a lot of people bring up as ‚Äúunity‚Äôs lost tech‚Äù.


>‚òù In unity 2019+ the Occlusion probes are supported natively if you‚Äôre using Shadowmask (or Subtractive) baking mode, which also utilizes main light occlusion and all the other fancy things. If you do not want that - you can still utilize the method described here

Occlusion probes are a cool technique to attenuate the ambient light intensity based on how occluded the skybox is from the particular point of view.

It relies on unity custom bake ‚ÄúAPI‚Äù (if you can call 2 functions and a property an API):

[Unity - Scripting API: Experimental.Lightmapping.SetCustomBakeInputs](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/Experimental.Lightmapping.SetCustomBakeInputs.html)

[Unity - Scripting API: Experimental.Lightmapping.GetCustomBakeResults](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/Experimental.Lightmapping.GetCustomBakeResults.html)

To generate a samples of the sky visibility from the particular sample point (which takes your static objects + transparency into account). It also allows you to remove ambient contribution from the regular LightProbes themselves, so then you can manually composite it based on the occlusion strength. Here‚Äôs a sample output

As you can see - the more occluded areas - get darker. So its basically a world-scale occlusion texture that is stored separately.

Despite being called ‚Äúprobes‚Äù the actual implementation Unity made didn‚Äôt really rely on ‚ÄúProbes‚Äù per-se. Instead it relied on creating a 3D texture from the output and then sampling it directly after setting it via the shader globals.

The whole process is describe here

Ctrl+F for the Occlusion Probes

There is also a github package that extracted the occlusion-probe specific code from the demo, so you wouldn‚Äôt need to download the whole thing

You can use it in a project together with a compatible shader to generate pretty interesting results
