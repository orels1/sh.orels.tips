When creating editor tools - you often need to display a Search UI for the user to find something in a large list of options.

The easiest way to do it is usually just a simple text field + a filter of sorts, like a `List<T>.Where` or even just a `foreach` loop with a continued when the condition fails.

Sometimes, however, you also want a tree-style UI with multiple layers of nesting. And those take time.

Things become even more involved when you want this UI to only be visible in some cases, preferably in a popup. All of that creates a lot of extra boilerplate for something that Unity, seemingly, already has.

And, indeed, it does! Unity's `GraphView` has a tree-style search window for all the nodes. So let's use that instead!

Here's an example of such a window in action

<video width="100%" style={{ aspectRatio: "16/9" }} autoplay muted loop controls>

## Implementation

Implementing something like this is actually pretty trivial! It's a shame Unity just doesn't provide any documentation.

First, we need to make what unity calls a "provider". It will be used to generate a list of options and handle the selection. Here's the basic layout of a provider

```cs
using System;  
using System.Collections.Generic;  
using UnityEditor.Experimental.GraphView;  
using UnityEngine;

public class CustomSearchProvider : ScriptableObject, ISearchWindowProvider
{
    public List<SearchTreeEntry> CreateSearchTree(SearchWindowContext context)
    {
        var entries = List<SearchTreeEntry>();
        entries.Add(new SearchTreeEntry(new GUIContent("Test Entry!")));
        return entries;
    }
public bool OnSelectEntry(SearchTreeEntry entry, SearchWindowContext context)
    {
        Debug.Log(entry.name);
        return true;
    }
}
```

As you can see, all we need to do is simply inherit from `ScriptableObject` and implement the `ISearchWindowProvider` interface.

The `CreateSearchTree` function is what is responsible for the search results. It creates a list of `SearchTreeEntry` elements that can be nested using the `SearchTreeGroupEntry` class with a particular `level`.

And then `OnSelectEntry` simply handles the selection. You can return `true` or `false` depending on whether the selection was successful.

This doesn't return anything useful yet, but let's create the actual window-showing logic before we do anything else.

Let's imagine that you have `CustomEditor` of sorts, where you implement a custom`OnGUI` method with a button that is meant to spawn this window.

```cs
if (GUILayout.Button("Open Search"))
{
    var searchContext = new SearchWindowContext(GUIUtility.GUIToScreenPoint(Event.current.mousePosition), 600, 300);
    var provider = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<CustomSearchProvider>();
    SearchWindow.Open(searchContext, provider);
}
```

The only odd-looking thing here is the `GUIToScreenPoint` call, which is required because we're not working in the `GraphView` context, so we need to make sure that the window actually gets offset to where the button is drawn. Otherwise, it will be off.

If you click the button now - a window with a single search entry should appear!

## Making This Useful

Now that you got the basics covered, you might be asking yourself, "how do I even pass my own search results without hardcoding them?". Valid question!

The most common way to do it is to add an extra `Init` method of sorts to the `CustomSearchProvider`. We can't do it in the constructor itself, as `ScriptableObject` requires a parameter-less constructor, so we settle for a custom method. Here's an example

```cs
public class CustomSearchProvider : ScriptableObject, ISearchWindowProvider
{
    // ..old code here
    private List<SearchTreeEntry> _searchResults;
    private Func<SearchTreeEntry, bool> _onSelected;

    public void Init(List<string> searchResults, Func<SearchTreeEntry, bool> onSelected)
    {
        _searchResult = new List<SearchTreeEntry>();
        _searchResults.Add(new SearchTreeGroupEntry(new GUIContent("Results"), 0)); // adds a little header up-top
        foreach(var result of searchResults)
        {
            _searchResults.Add(new SearchTreeEntry(new GUIContent(result)));
        }
        _onSelected = onSelected;
    }
}
```

Now you have your custom data saved in the particular instance of the search provider. All you need is to edit the original `CreateSearchTree` and `OnSelectEntry` methods to utilize them

```cs
public class CustomSearchProvider : ScriptableObject, ISearchWindowProvider
{
    public List<SearchTreeEntry> CreateSearchTree(SearchWindowContext context)
    {
        return _searchResults;
    }
public bool OnSelectEntry(SearchTreeEntry entry, SearchWindowContext context)
    {
        return _onSelected?.Invoke(entry) ?? false;
    }

    // private List<SearchTreeEntry> _searchResults and others below
}
```

And now just call that `Init` before `ShowWindow` and you're good to go!

```cs
if (GUILayout.Button("Open Search"))
{
    var searchContext = new SearchWindowContext(GUIUtility.GUIToScreenPoint(Event.current.mousePosition), 600, 300);
    var provider = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<CustomSearchProvider>();
    provider.Init(new List<string> { "Result 1", "Result 2" }, entry => {
        Debug.Log(entry);
        return true;
    });
    SearchWindow.Open(searchContext, provider);
}
```

Pretty simple and saves you a ton of time developing your own custom search experience 🙏

Hope it saves you some time in the future ❤️
