Because blender is very dum dum - they don't allow you to create a new "Template" easily, which is annoying. And the guides are kinda confusing. So here's a tl;dr

- Make a new blendfile and set up everything like you want your new template to be (layouts, materials, default meshes, everything)
- Save it in a folder called the way you want your new template to be called, e.g. `Matcap`
- Name the file `startup.blend`
- Put this [`__init__.py`](/downloads/tips/creating-blender-startup-template/__init__.py) file into the same folder

> The `__init__.py` is just an empty blender init script that does absolutely nothing!

- Zip the folder
- Open blender, open search and type `Install Application Template`

- Point it to the archive you just made and load it up
- You should now have this new template in your `File` → `New` menu!

> The best part about it is that you now also have a separate startup file just for that template. Which means you can edit your specific setup without ruining any of the General defaults you already had!

Hope that helps! ♥️
