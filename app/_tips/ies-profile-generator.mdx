IES Profiles are great! And there are [some awesome libraries](/ies-lights-library) of pre-built profiles available.

But sometimes you want a custom looking light. It used to be that you had to figure out some ancient software to get something you want. It was obscure and hard to use.

But now a new tool is available! Totally free (although donations are recommended if you're using it commercially).

It is node-based and you can [download it here](https://cndl.io/).
