Unity replacement shaders have some internal logic to copy over ShaderLab commands from the original shader. However, it seems to be a little flawed, which results in unpredictable shader behaviour in some cases.

E.g. if a shader defines a `ZWrite [_ZWrite]` - the shader replacement logic seems to copy the value of the first rendered object's `_ZWrite` property into the global state and then use that across other objects, which is undesirable.

Some commands also aren't included at all unless one of the more common ones - like `ZWrite` is also defined.

E.g. if a shader has `ColorMask R` - that `ColorMask` command won't be copied unless something like `ZWrite` is also explicitly set on the shader. Furthermore, if your `ColorMask` is driven by some property, like `ColorMask [_ColorMask]` the state of that property won't be copied over, the shader will get an error and the mesh won't be rendered at all.

Another thing to pay attention to is the `Blend` command, as that is also copied over, so you can get undesirable effects like doing blending inside the DepthNormals buffer.

This behaviour might also be limited to the DepthNormals Replacement Shader as well
