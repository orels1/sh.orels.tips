Unity ships with a lot of custom icons, so you often don’t need to draw your own!

[Here’s a nifty table of all of them](https://github.com/halak/unity-editor-icons).

> Check the Unity version at the top of the list, if you’re using older unity - you might not have all the icons

You can utilize those by loading them as a texture using

```cs
var icon = EditorGUIUtility.IconContent(<iconName>);
var iconTex = (Texture2D) icon.image;
```

In newer unity you can also set the icon on individual objects using SetIconForObject. If you’re not on Unity 2021, you need to reflect it, like this

```cs
private MethodInfo setIconForObject = typeof(EditorGUIUtility).GetMethod("SetIconForObject", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic);

// ...

var icon = EditorGUIUtility.IconContent("sv_icon_dot11_pix16_gizmo");
setIconForObject.Invoke(null, new object[] {newPoint, icon.image});
```

Otherwise just do

```cs
EditorGUIUtility.SetIconForObject(gameObject, (Texture2D) iconContent.image);
```
