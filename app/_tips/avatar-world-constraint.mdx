- Create an empty gameobject, and turn it into a prefab by drag and dropping in into the project explorer
- Delete that prefab from your scene
- Layout an hierarchy like this: `<Your avatar>/.../ToWorld/ToAvatar/<The object you want to drop in world space>`.
- In ToWorld, add a Parent Constraint
    - Click "+", and drag and drop the prefab from the project explorer directly onto the slot. You don't need to have the prefab existing in your scene.
    - Press Activate
- In ToAvatar, place the ToAvatar object so that the object you want to drop in world space lines up with the bone that will drop it, or a child of the bone that will drop it.
    - Example: If you need to drop it from the avatar left hand, position the ToAvatar object so that the object will be correctly positioned onto the avatar left hand
    - Create a child gameobject within ToAvatar, and change its position in the hierarchy so that it is a child of the bone that will be followed to place the object (in the video, it is called Avatar Hand)
- In ToAvatar, add a Parent Constraint
    - Click "+", and drag and drop the followed gameobject (in the video, it is called Avatar Hand)
    - Press Activate(edited)
