When your shader has a warning/error - unity will show that in the inspector for that shader file.
It also includes the name of the file the error came from.

For reasons only known to unity - that file name is truncated to the rightmost space.
So something like `My Custom Lighting.hlsl` will turn into `Lighting.hlsl` which might make you think the error comes from unity's built in file and not `My Custom Lighting.hlsl`
