When creating a new unity project - it will often pull in outdated versions of some packages that will yell about updating. And we donâ€™t like yelling!

So here goes, how to edit the default dependencies of a new project template

1. Navigate to `<YourUnityInstallPath>\2019.4.31f1\Editor\Data\Resources\PackageManager\ProjectTemplates`
2. Clone the template you want to edit, default 3d one is `com.unity.template.3d-4.2.8.tgz`
3. Inside - navigate to `package/ProjectData~/Packages` and open `manifest.json`
4. Add any dependencies you want, like this

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"com.unity.ide.rider": "3.0.15"
	}
}
```

1. Save the updated .tgz archive and put it back into the `ProjectTemplates` folder, overriding the old one
2. Go ahead and make a new project - you will now have an updated dependency right out of the box! Feel free to add more things to the `ProjectData~` as you see fit
