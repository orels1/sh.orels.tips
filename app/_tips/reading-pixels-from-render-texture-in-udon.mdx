## Updated in June 2023

You can now use AsyncGPUReadback to read pixels from a Render Texture in Udon. This is much faster than the method described below.

[Here is the official documentation page](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/asyncgpureadback).

```cs
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.Rendering;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;
​
public class AGPURB : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public Texture texture;
​
    void Start()
    {
        VRCAsyncGPUReadback.Request(texture, 0, (IUdonEventReceiver)this);
    }
​
    public void OnAsyncGpuReadbackComplete(VRCAsyncGPUReadbackRequest request)
    {
        if (request.hasError)
        {
            Debug.LogError("GPU readback error!");
            return;
        }
        else
        {
            var px = new Color[texture.width * texture.height];
            Debug.Log("GPU readback success: " + request.TryGetData(px));
            Debug.Log("GPU readback data: " + px[0]);
        }
    }
}
```

The main benefit of the new method is that it doesn't force a GPU sync, and thus doesnt stall the main thread until the frame is ready on the GPU. This async method has a tradeoff of being a couple frames delayed, but most of the time performance benefits outweigh the delay.

## Older, slower method

```cs
// Attach this behavior to a Camera that writes into a RenderTexture
public class RenderTextureReader : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public Texture2D proxyTexture;

    private Rect _rect;

    private void Start()
    {
        _rect = GetComponent<Camera>().pixelRect;
    }

    private void OnPostRender()
    {
        proxyTexture.ReadPixels(_rect, 0, 0, false);
        proxyTexture.Apply(false);
        Color[] pixels = proxyTexture.GetPixels();
    }
}
```
