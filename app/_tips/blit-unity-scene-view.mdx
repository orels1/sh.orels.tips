If you ever wanted to capture the whole of Unity Scene View into a texture - [here's a method that lets you do just that](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference/blob/master/Editor/Mono/InternalEditorUtility.cs#L670)

A simple setup to copy scene view every frame would look like this
- Create a new Render Texture with your desired resolution 
    - for best results you would want to check the size of your scene view and match it
- Create a script with an `[ExecuteInEditMode]` attribute
    - Or wire it to some other update loop, like `onEditorUpdate`
- Call `InternalEditorUtility.CaptureSceneView(SceneView.lastActiveSceneView, rt);`
```cs
using UnityEditor;  
using UnityEditorInternal;  
using UnityEngine;  
  
[ExecuteInEditMode]  
public class SceneBlitter : MonoBehaviour  
{  
    public RenderTexture rt;  
    void Update()  
    {
        if (rt)  
        {
            InternalEditorUtility.CaptureSceneView(SceneView.lastActiveSceneView, rt);  
        }
    }
}
```

Internally, that simply does a copy via `sceneViewInstance.m_Parent.GrabPixels`

> It is worth noting that the cropping of the final texture seems to be off, so you might want to use the `GrabPixels` method directly and pass the correctly size rect as the second argument to work around that
