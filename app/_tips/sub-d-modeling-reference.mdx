Modeling with SUB-D is always a hard topic for me personally, and while the benefits of it are numerous (great topo, “built-in” low poly, etc), I often fall back to boolean+bevel flow. Which works well for some things, and not so well for others.

Having great reference for sub-d flows is always imperative, imho, so hope this helps
