Sometimes you might need to offset the objects on z-axis to make them appear in front of others, e.g. Decals. Hereâ€™s an example of how to do it in a vertex shader

```hlsl
o.pos = UnityObjectToClipPos(v.vertex);
float3 cameraVec = mul(unity_WorldToObject, float4(_WorldSpaceCameraPos, 1)).xyz - v.vertex.xyz;
float4 tmpVertex = float4(v.vertex.xyz + normalize(cameraVec) * _ZOffsetAmount, 1);
float4 clipPos2 = UnityObjectToClipPos(tmpVertex);

o.pos.z = clipPos2.z * o.pos.w / o.pos.z;
```
