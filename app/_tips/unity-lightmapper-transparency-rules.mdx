Unity Lightmapper has support for Semi-Transparent and Cutout materials. However, there is a lot of special logic when it comes to figuring out if the material is considered to be transparent.

This is the rough list of rules the Lightmapper follows


These are considered Transparent
- If the material has a texture property called `_TransparencyLM`. This is a special property that even allows for colored shadows from transparent materials. [Read more here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MetaPass.html)
- If the shader name includes the following words anywhere
    - `Transparent`
    - `Leaf`
    - `Leaves`
- If the material uses a render queue above or equals `Transparent` and below `Overlay`
- If the shader has the following tags
    - `Transparent`
    - `GrassBillboard`
    - `Grass`
    - `TreeLeaf`

These are considered Cutout
- If material's render queue is above `AlphaTest` and below `Transparent`
- If the shader has the following tags
    - `TreeTransparentCutout`
    - `TransparentCutout`
- If SpeedTree-related keywords are present on the material

### Extra Notes

If the material is treated as Cutout and has a `_Cutoff` or `_AlphaTestRef` properties - the lightmapper will use those to adjust the threshold for clipping.

> If the material is Transparent or Cutout - it must have a defined `_MainTex` as the lightmapper will use it as a source of alpha. The only exception is when you're using the `_TransparentLM` texture for custom colored transparency
