Creating persistent unity event listeners is a bit of a pain because unity decided we dont need a nice api for it.

The gist of it is simple - we use `UnityEventTools` class to register them, but first we need to reflect our delegate and that part is where a lot of people give up.

Here’s a general flow of how this is meant to work

1. Get a valid MethodInfo that can be used with UnityEvents via `UnityEvent.GetValidMethodInfo()`
2. Create a delegate with `Delegate.CreateDelegate()`
3. Pass it all to `UnityEventTools.Add<Type>PersistentListner(targetEvent, delegate, eventParam)`

Here is how you would add a Method call that takes a string (VRC Udon’s SendCustomEvent)

```cs
var btn = newObj.GetComponent<Button>();
var targetInfo = UnityEvent.GetValidMethodInfo(UdonSharpEditorUtility.GetBackingUdonBehaviour(t), "SendCustomEvent", new []{typeof(string)});
var methodDelegate = Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(UnityAction<string>), UdonSharpEditorUtility.GetBackingUdonBehaviour(t), targetInfo) as UnityAction<string>;
UnityEventTools.AddStringPersistentListener(btn.onClick, methodDelegate, "MyAmazingParameter");
```

Not the prettiest code but that is the general flow of things. You could clean it up a bit by pre-fetching the backing behaviour and such, just so you dont need to call that and `typeof` all the time. But that doesnt change the substance of this code

Here’s another example of adding a call to a Unity AudioSource’s `PlayOneShot`

```cs
var btn = newObj.GetComponent<Button>();
var targetInfo = UnityEvent.GetValidMethodInfo(yourAudioSource, "PlayOneShot", new []{typeof(AudioClip)});
var methodDelegate = Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(UnityAction<AudioClip>), yourAudioSource, targetInfo) as UnityAction<AudioClip>;
UnityEventTools.AddObjectPersistentListener(btn.onClick, methodDelegate, yourAudioClip);
```
