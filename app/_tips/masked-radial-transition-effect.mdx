Masked transitions are the lifeblood of a lot of VFX, hereâ€™s a nice general purpose how-to guide.

![Masked Radial Transition Guide](/img/tips/masked-radial-transition-effect/guide.jfif "Masked Radial Transition Guide")

The gist of effects like this is to create a tiled texture with some sort of a gradient shape, which would allow for an interesting fadeout effect which looks like the shape is being scaled.

Then to multiply it by the transition shape you are tyring to achieve. So if you want it to transition in a circular pattern - multiply it by a radial gradient. If you want it to transition linearly, e.g. side-to-side - multiply it by a linear side-to-side gradient, etc.

Then you just apply a threshold (a `smoothstep` or even just `step` in sahder land) and then offset it to create the transition effect.

Here's a simple reference shader

```hlsl
Properties
{
    _MaskTex("Mask Texture", 2D) = "white" {}
    _Progress("Transition Progress", Range(0,1)) = 0
}

//...

Texture2D<float4> _MaskTex;
SamplerState sampler_MaskTex;

//...

float4 frag(v2f i) : SV_Target
{
    float4 color = float4(0.5,0.5,0.5, 1); // some base color
    float4 otherColor = float4(1,1,0,1); // color to fade

    var mask = _MaskTex.Sample(sampler_MaskTex, i.uv); // sample the mask texture

    var factor = step(_Progress, mask);

    color.rgb = lerp(color, otherColor, mask);

    return color;
}
```

Adjusting `_Progress` should now fade the color from `color` to `otherColor` based on the mask texture.

My ORL Shaders package has a built in shader that can achieve similar effects with an added feature of doing a cutout dissolve. [Check it out!](https://shaders.orels.sh/docs/orl-standard/dissolve)
