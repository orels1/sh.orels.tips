Unreal Marketplace has hundreds of amazing asset packs, but if your main engine is Unity - migrating them over can be a total chore. There are some automated solutions out there, but they all have their downsides. But thanks to @Rainwolf#0239 - we now have a solution that works pretty well.

## GLTF

GLTF is an open source file format that can be used to store 3D models, and, more importantly, whole scenes with materials!

We're going to leverage that ability to import Unreal Engine asset packs into Unity.

## Exporting from Unreal

First of all - you'll need to [Follow this guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/exporting-unreal-engine-content-to-gltf/) to set up the GLTF exporter in Unreal Engine.

Here's a quick summary:

- In your content browser - right click the level you want to export
- Select "Asset Actions" > "Export..."
- Select the `.gltf` file format
- Click "Save"

This should kick off the export process, which might take a while.

> It's important to note that Unity cannot import GLTF files more than 4GB, so it is not recommended to transfer giant demo scenes like that without splitting them into chunks. Alternatively - you can export the asset grid scene to just get the base assets only.

## Importing into Unity

Unity does not natively understand the GLTF format (what a shame!). But thankfully the community have made numerous plugins to help us out.

We're going to use the UniGLTF plugin created by the VRM project.

To add this plugin - download the `UniVRM-VERSION.unitypackage` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases/tag/v0.110.0) and import it into your project.

After that is done - you should be able to simply drag & drop the .gltf file into your project and it will import the whole scene!

Every texture will be bundled in, as well as every material, and all the textures will be re-converted into the Unity-compatible formats and the Standard shader will be used on all materials.

Hope that helps~~
