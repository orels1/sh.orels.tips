You can use this in your vertex shader to make the far plane of the camera effectively infinite

```hlsl
float4x4 INF_PERSPECTIVE = UNITY_MATRIX_P;
INF_PERSPECTIVE._m22 = 0.000000953674;
OUT.vertex = mul(INF_PERSPECTIVE, mul(UNITY_MATRIX_V, mul(unity_ObjectToWorld, float4(v.vertex.xyz, 1.0))));
```
