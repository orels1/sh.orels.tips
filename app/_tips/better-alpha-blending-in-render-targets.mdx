There is an issue with the default `Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha` blending, that if you have a transparent object on top of an opaque object - the final alpha value will be altered in the render target.

Usually that is not a problem, until you‚Äôre starting to use render textures in a transparent shader. In that case, all of a sudden, your transparent objects will make everything behind them appear transparent too, instead of blending properly on top.

You can solve that by utilizing the split blending available in the `Blend/BlendOp` commands, which allows you to define different blending logic for RGB and Alpha channels.

Huge thanks to `d4rkpl4y3r` for spending time writing it out üôè

Here‚Äôs the code

```hlsl
Pass
{
	ZWrite [ZWrite]
	BlendOp Add, Max
	Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha, One One
	Tas { "LightMode" = "ForwardBase" }

	CGPROGRAM
	#pragma multi_compile_fwdbase
	#pragma multi_compile _ VERTEXLIGHT_ON
	// rest of your code
	ENDCG
}

Pass
{
	ZWrite Off
	Blend SrcAlpha One, Zero One
	Tags { "LightMode" = "ForwardAdd" }
	
	CGPROGRAM
	#pragma multi_compile_fwdadd
	// rest of your code
	ENDCG
}
```
