![Splash](/public/orels-tips-splash.png?raw=true)

> My personal dumping ground for all the random pieces of knowledge I find and discover myself. I have always collected things like this, but they have become too spread out over the years. This place is meant to be an organized spot for that

Where possible - I include the name of the person who shared the tip/guide somewhere that isn't linkable. Otherwise - I try to link directly to the source.

Hope you find this useful!
